Dr. Vicens-Miquel joined the School of Meteorology in Summer 2024 and is a postdoctoral research associate working under the guidance of Dr. Amy McGovern and Dr. Aaron Hill. Her postdoctoral research focuses on enhancing the accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and explainability of extreme precipitation predictions through advanced machine-learning techniques.

Dr. Vicens-Miquel holds a double major BS in Computer Science and Mathematics, as well as a Ph.D. in Geospatial Computer Science from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi. Her doctoral research concentrated on applying machine learning to coastal studies, with a particular focus on predicting coastal inundation.
