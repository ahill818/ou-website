<h1>Two Open Graduate Research Assistantships (Masters or Ph.D.) at OU School of Meteorology</h1>

<p>The CHAOS research group led by Dr. Aaron Hill in the School of Meteorology at OU is seeking at least two Graduate Research Assistants (M.S. or Ph.D. Level) beginning Spring or Fall 2026. Research projects will be related to artificial intelligence and machine learning applications for extreme temperatures and rainfall.

Project 1: The GRA on this project will be tasked with designing and implementing an AI prediction system for extreme temperature predictions on sub-seasonal timescales. The project is in collaboration with Dr. Jason Furtado in the School who will co-supervise the student. The GRA will be expected to work independently as well as with the project team and a second GRA (primarily advised by Dr. Furtado) to advance the prediction system. 

Project 2: The GRA on this project will develop extreme rainfall prediction systems with machine learning and deep learning algorithms to assist operational forecasters at the Weather Prediction Center. The student will be expected to work with multiple project partners at Colorado State University and the University of North Carolina to curate datasets for model training and analysis. 

How to Apply: Please contact Dr. Aaron Hill (ahill@ou.edu) to express your intent to apply for one of these positions. Prospective students must apply for admission to the Graduate College through the <a href="https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/apply">Office of Admissions and Records</a>.

Please see our website on “<a href="http://ou.edu/ags/meteorology/people/graduate-students#apply">How to Apply</a>” for more information. The application deadline is 1 December, but we accept applications past this deadline. 
 
Qualifications: 
1.  A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in atmospheric sciences, physics, environmental sciences, computer science, or related areas. 
2.  Experience with data analysis and visualization using programming languages is preferred. Python is the primary language used in the CHAOS group. 
3.  Ability to work independently and as a team, contributing to the breadth of research within the School of Meteorology.
4.  Excellent English oral and written communication skills. 
5.  Experience with machine learning and deep learning models is desirable.
