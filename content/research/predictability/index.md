Predictability of convective processes is easily discerned through the application of Ensemble Sensitivity Analysis (ESA), which relates changes in model initial conditions to changes in a forecast metric through univariate regressions. ESA is capable of diagnosing dynamic regions and features that are critical to successful forecasts of convection initiation and intensity (e.g., Hill et al. 2016). I continue to employ ESA to examine dynamic sensitivies of convection forecasts with convection-allowing models (e.g., Hill et al. 2016, Hill et al. 2021) and am interested in exploring how sensitivities vary across convection regimes and climates.
